            FabMo is an open-source digital fabrication and motion platform of software and hardware. Initiated by the development team at ShopBot Tools, FabMo
            is meant to be adapted by and used by anyone, to run every smart tool imaginable, today and tomorrow.

            <h3>Freedom of Access</h3>
            <h4>Access your digital fabrication tools from any device (whether a subtractive CNC tool or an additive 3D printer):</h4>
            <p>
              FabMo will link your network-enabled devices to your digital fab tool. Access a tool from your phone or via any computer. Control the tool or just
              monitor the action. Do it wirelessly, or hardwire with ethernet or USB to achieve industrial robustness. Use job files from your cloud storage,
              or only use locally generated files. You have the freedom.

            <h4>Generate machine files from a wide range of programs (CAD/CAM) or from digital-fabrication apps:</h4>
            <p>
              FabMo supports a wide range of digital-fab workflows from a traditional CAD > CAM approach to the increasing range of "apps". Some of these "apps" are
              oriented to carrying out common jobs, others can produce complex digital-fab projects whose parameters can be customized by you! FabMo supports several
              motion languages including OpenSBP and legacy g-code. New languages can be added. Go FabMo to create, produce, and manufacture in ways that suit your style.

            <h4>Modify FabMo to fit your needs or the needs of your specialized tools:</h4>
            <p>
              We're encouraging the open creation of a system that will evolve to meet the needs of the fabrication, motion, and robotics community and provide a platform for shared innovation.
              Several development system hardware options are available to designers, and the software organization is modular and understandable. At the lowest level,
              the sophistaicated FabMo motion is provided by G2 - a real-time, motion system core developed originally by the Synthetos team. At higher levels, FabMo
              manages files, projects, and apps and links your tool to the world.
